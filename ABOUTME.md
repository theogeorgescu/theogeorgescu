- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @theogeorgescu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in bringing literature to life through programming. This is the primary reason I'm currently creating digital and interactive stories on mobile platforms such as Episode and Spotlight, using various scripting languages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Economic Informatics in English at Bucharest University of Economic Studies.
